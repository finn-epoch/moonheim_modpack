[3 - Reclaiming]

## Rate at which the resources are recycled. Value must be between 0 and 1.
## The mod always rolls *down*, so if you were supposed to get 2.5 items, you would only receive 2. If the recycling rate is 0.5 (50%), the player will receive half of the resources they would usually need to craft the item, assuming a single item in a stack and the item is of quality level 1. If the item is of higher quality, the resulting yield would be higher as well. [Synced with Server]
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 0.5
RecyclingRate = 1

## If enabled and recycling a specific _unstackable_ item would yield 0 of a material,
## instead you will receive 1. If disabled, you get nothing. [Synced with Server]

# Setting type: Toggle
# Default value: On
# Acceptable values: Off, On
PreventZeroResourceYields = On

## If enabled, it will allow you to recycle items that you do not know the recipe for yet.

ContainerRecyclingEnabled = On

## If enabled and recycling a specific item runs into any issues, the mod will print a message
## in the center of the screen (native Valheim notification). At the time of implementation,
## this happens in the following cases:
##  - not enough free slots in the inventory to place the resulting resources
##  - player does not know the recipe for the item
